# TicTacToe

A simple TicTacToe game implemented in Java using a command-line interface. This project demonstrates basic OOP concepts, including classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation.

## Features
- Two-player game (Player X and Player O)
- Players can make moves by choosing an empty square
- Displays the current state of the game after each move
- Notifies when the game ends in a win, loss, or draw
- Allows players to start a new game after the current game ends

## User Stories

- **US2**: As a player, I want to be able to see the current state of the game, so that I can keep track of the moves made by both myself and my opponent.
- **US3**: As a player, I want to be notified when the game has ended in a win, loss, or draw, so that I can see the result of the game.
- **US4**: As a player, I want to be able to start a new game after the current game has ended, so that I can play again.
